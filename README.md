# Employee_Management_System
This Employee Management System is a Java-based desktop application designed to streamline the process of managing employee records, including adding, viewing, updating, and removing employee data. Built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface, it interacts with a MySQL database for persistent data storage and retrieval. The application leverages several essential tools: jcalendar-tz-1.3.3-4 is used to provide a user-friendly date picker component for selecting dates (e.g., employee date of birth), mysql-connector-java-8.0.28 facilitates seamless JDBC connectivity between the Java application and MySQL database, and ResultSet2xml aids in converting database result sets into XML for efficient data manipulation and display. This system ensures a smooth, intuitive experience for managing employee information effectively.
